The inital reason to creating this addon, was so i could "CTRL+Click" on one of
my bookmark folders which contain (quite a few) bookmarks and the containing
bookmarks would open without the browser freezing or becoming unresponsive,
because i am sure my PC is a actually a potato in disguise. Since i could not
find any other addon which at the time seemed to be able to do this, i created
this addon to fill the gap.

<b>Usage/Features</b>
<ul>
  <li>open background tabs (for example via CTRL+Left Mouse Button)</li>
  <li>(optional) set black/-whitelist URLs on the preference page</li>
</ul>
