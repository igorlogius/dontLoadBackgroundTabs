Prevents tabs which are opend in the background from loading until they have been manually activated once

The inital reason to creating this addon, was so i could "CTRL+Click" on one of my bookmark folders which contain (quite a few) bookmarks and the containing bookmarks would open without the browser freezing or becoming unresponsive, because  i am sure my PC is a actually a potato in disguise.

Since i could not find any other addon  ( for example: "LoadTabOnSelect" , "LoadTabOnSelect Evolution" or "LoadTabOnSelect 3")  which seem to be able to handle it, i decided to (Thanos voice: Do it myself.

Actually i wrote 2 addons, one which sequentializes the loading (loads one tab at a time) and this one, which prevents the loading entirely until the user selects (aka. activates) the tabs. Pick whichever you like.
